	The URLs go below this comment block
	in the following format:

Heading Text here
http://www.example.com
http://www.example.net
http://www.example.tv
http://www.example.biz
http://www.example.org
http://www.example2.com
http://example.com/foo/bar

Second  heading here
http://www.example.com
http://www.example.com

	The headings will be used as separators, and every heading will start a new
	page. Every line that isn't an URL (start with http://), will be treated as
	a heading.

	Website Thumbnails should be placed to the "thumbnails" directory which you
	will find from the same directory as this file.

	The thumbnails should be named according the domain
	name. For example if you have URL like "http://gocom.deviantart.com/",
	the thumbnail would be named as "gocom.deviantart.com.png" (with out the quotes).

	So, for instance, thumbnails for following URLs would be:

	http://wwww.example.com/path/to/something => www.example.com.png
	http://example.net => example.net.png

	Below are the example links bundled with the default package. You can replace
	defaults with your own.
