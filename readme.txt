jQuery Team <http://jquery.com>
for wonderful jQuery JavaScript library

Orman Clark <http://www.premiumpixels.com>
for the Newsletter Sign-up Form PSD 
<http://www.premiumpixels.com/newsletter-sign-up-form-psd/>
that worked as the inspiration for the design.

Instructions:
--

The URLs go to the "index.html" file in the following type of format:

	Heading Text here
	http://www.example.com
	http://www.example.net
	http://www.example.tv
	http://www.example.biz
	http://www.example.org
	http://www.example2.com
	http://example.com/foo/bar
		
	Second  heading here
	http://www.example.com
	http://www.example.com

The headings will be used as separators, and every heading will start a new
page. Every line that isn't an URL (start with http://), will be treated as
a heading.

Website Thumbnails should be placed to the "thumbnails" directory which you
will find from the same directory as this file.

The thumbnails should be named according the domain
name. For example if you have URL like: "http://gocom.deviantart.com/",
the thumbnail would be named as "gocom.deviantart.com.png" (without quotes).

Only images saved with .png extensions will be supported. Image dimensions should be 160x70 px.


What about multiple URLs with identical domain?
Can they have different thumbnails?
__

If there are multiple URLs with the same domain (for example http://domain1.com/forum and http://domain1.com/blog), the reoccurring thumbnails' will be suffixed with a number that represents the order they appear.

For example URLs like: "http://domain1.com/forum", "http://domain1.com/gallery" and "http://domain1.com/blog" would use thumbnails "domain1.com.png", "domain1.com_2.png" and "domain1.com_3.png".
